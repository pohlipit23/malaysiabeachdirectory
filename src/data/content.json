The area is framed by ancient limestone caves and uninhabited islands. The water is shallow and clear, and during low tide, it's possible to walk across a sandbank to the nearby islands. It's a much more peaceful and secluded alternative to Pantai Cenang, home to some of the island's most luxurious resorts. The sunsets here are legendary, painting the sky with spectacular colors over the unique sea stacks.",
